Starter code for MTM, the mobile version of the TODO List application
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source code for the existing mobile TODO List application. Please import the project in Eclipse and feel free to update the target Android SDK version to the one that best suits you.

We recommend the use of the [Genymotion Android emulator](http://www.genymotion.com/). The free version is fully functional and is much faster than the standard Android emulator. Genymotion is getting increasingly popular and is well maintained for now.

To install and configure Genymotion:

1. Download and install Genymotion. Reference: [Section "Installation" of the User Guide](https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/doc/#collapse4).
2. Create new devices with Genymotion. Reference: [Section "Quick start" of the User Guide](https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/doc/#collapse5).
3. Install and configure Genymotion's Eclipse plugin. Reference: [Section "Eclipse Plugin" of the User Guide](https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/doc/#collapse8).
