# Process Plan Document – Team 22

## 1 Introduction
After a successful prototype, Initech is interested in the development of a web client to compliment the initial Android TODO List Manager app. The existing Android application is to be improved upon and will synchronize conveniently with the web client. 

### 1.1 Definitions and Acronyms
The following is a list of definitions and acronyms that are associated with this project.


- **MTM** – The Mobile TODO List Manager, which runs on the Android platform.

- **WTM** - The Web TODO List Manager, which runs on any standard web browser.


## 2 Process Description

### 2.1 Project Lifecycle

Using the Unified Software Development Process, the TODO List Manager project will be extended in functionality and expanded to the web platform in addition to existing as an Android application. Using the existing Android app as a starting point, the team will plan and specify necessary changes and iterate until they are realized.  

### 2.2 Process Activities

#### Project Planning
We will assess the current state of the Android application as presented to us and determine where to go from there in accordance to requirements stated in the project description. Initial versions of the vision document, use-cases, risk assessment, process plan, and UI will also be delivered.
* Entrance criteria: Access to existing code repository.
* Exit criteria: Process plan outlined, initial documents created, and prototypes for MTM and WTM. 

#### Project Design
We will further improve upon the aforementioned project documents as well as complete the requirements gathering process. The software design will be laid out and an initial executable prototype will be created. 
* Entrance criteria: Items in the Project Planning phase created (at lest in inital form).
* Exit criteria: Existing documents revised, requirements gathering complete, initial design model and project architecture laid out, initial test cases, user manual, and executable prototype.

#### Project Development
We will refine the prototype until it completely satisfies all of the requirements. In addition, we will implement the test plan and refine the user manual. 
* Entrance Criteria: Initial executable prototype and documents have been created.
* Exit Criteria: The software completely satisfies all of the requirements.

#### Complete and Release Product
We will deliver the software product and perform a post-mortem assessment of the project process.
* Entrance Criteria: The application completely satisfies all of the requirements.
* Exit Criteria: Application released and project assessed.
